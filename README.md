# student-performance-indicator-ml-project

📊 Student Performance Indicator (ML Project)

📌 Overview

This project aims to predict student performance (test scores) based on various demographic and educational factors. By applying Linear Regression, the project identifies how features such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course affect student outcomes.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the relationship between demographic/academic features and test scores.

Apply Linear Regression for prediction.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover key insights.

Achieve a reliable model for predicting student performance.
